title: Coming to a Computing Consensus 
---
As web technology has permeated our lives, ecology has evolved from a field of siloed research to one of synthesis and scaling. Ecology at scale requires an emphasis on project management (PM) to coordinate teams, data, and analysis over space and time. Yet researchers rarely receive formal training in PM skills and tools. We will discuss web-enabled PM tools inspired by distributed software development communities and illustrate how web connectivity can drive both bigger ecology, and new approaches to collaboration and discovery. Participants will reflect on past collaborations, work through a consensus-building exercise to develop guidelines for future collaboration, and leave with a renewed toolkit of web-based PM tools.
