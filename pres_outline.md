**LTER-ASM &quot;Computing Consensus&quot; Workshop**

**Organizers:** Braeden Van Deynze, Christie Bahlai, Chad Zirbel

**Time:** 1.5 hours

**Audience:** Ecologists (mostly) from various LTER sites across the country/world

**Goal:** Explore challenges and solutions to working on modern, data-intensive collaborative projects over long-distances

**Published Abstract:** As web technology has permeated our lives, ecology has evolved from a field of siloed research to one of synthesis and scaling. Ecology at scale requires an emphasis on project management (PM) to coordinate teams, data, and analysis over space and time. Yet researchers rarely receive formal training in PM skills and tools. We will discuss web-enabled PM tools inspired by distributed software development communities and illustrate how web connectivity can drive both bigger ecology, and new approaches to collaboration and discovery. Participants will reflect on past collaborations, work through a consensus-building exercise to develop guidelines for future collaboration, and leave with a renewed toolkit of web-based PM tools. _(Can update as needed.)_

      3. What is a fork?
      4. Using the issues page?
   3. Include walk-through of an active or complete project (anyone have one available?)
      1. Christie&#39;s Lab Repo [https://github.com/BahlaiLab](https://github.com/BahlaiLab) / [https://github.com/ReproducibleQM](https://github.com/ReproducibleQM)

   4. Pros of GitHub
      1. Brainstorm with group
      2. Provides a lot of useful tools all in one place
      3. Allows for easy &quot;internal&quot; collaboration by synchronizing changes with version control
      4. Allows for easy &quot;external&quot; collaboration by allowing for public code, progress, which also allows for easy on-boarding of new collaborators
   5. Cons of GitHub
      1. Brainstorm with group
      2. Can be a learning curve (solutions?)
      3. Can get messy without good hygiene (solutions?)
   6. Resources for learning more
   7. Other tools?
      1. Google Docs
      2. OneDrive/Office 365

**Small Group Discussion Outline and Guiding Questions:**

_Goal:_ Identify major issues and discuss potential solutions for sharing with the larger group

_Deliverable Product:_ Some core &quot;frustrations&quot; in research collaborations; brainstorm of potential solutions to these issues

_Format:_ Split into 3- to 4-person groups (depending on attendance); provide each group with notepad and pen; designate notetaker/reporter for each group; work through guiding questions with end product in mind

_Guiding Questions/Topic:_

1. Intro to discussion
   1. We&#39;ll be sharing reflections on past collaborative experiences with each other
   2. Focus on digital aspects: what tools worked, what didn&#39;t, why?
2. Group: Introduction
   1. Institution/LTER Site
   2. Role (grad student, post-doc, prof, other…)
   3. Research Area
3. Reflect on a past experience (focus on group characteristics, rather than individuals)
   1. Solo: Think of a research collaboration you&#39;ve worked on (doesn&#39;t matter how big the group was, how dispersed you were, how long the project lasted, whether it&#39;s ongoing or not, what the result of the project was)
      1. What was the goal of the project (e.g., a paper, a novel dataset, a grant proposal, an outreach program, etc.)?
      2. How many people were involved? What kind of people (e.g., interdisciplinary, different career stages, different technical expertise, etc.)?
      3. Was the group based in one location? How long did the collaboration last?
   2. Group: Share brief descriptions of collaboration
   3. Group: Share one or two &quot;highlights&quot; – What worked smoothly in this group?
      1. After everyone shares… why? What facilitated these successes?
   4. Group: Share one or two &quot;frustrations&quot; – What could have gone better in this group?
      1. After everyone shares… why? What led to these frustrations?
4. Looking forward to future collaborations (focus on tool choices, rather than individuals)
   1. Group: Share &quot;targets&quot; – What do you look for when considering potential collaborations?
   2. Group: Share &quot;red flags&quot; – What would worry you about potential collaborations?
   3. Group: What might be done to move a &quot;red flag&quot; group to a group you would be excited to work with?
5. Prep time for consensus building
   1. Group: Brainstorm with just small group some &quot;commandments&quot; for cross-site collaboration in LTER

**Consensus Building Outline:**

_Goal:_ Develop a &quot;Ten Commandments&quot; for cross-site collaboration in LTER

_Format:_ One facilitator serves as &quot;scribe&quot;, recording ideas on easel board or presentation screen; other facilitators serve as &quot;facilitators&quot;, moving discussion forward

1. Layout some rules and goals
   1. What consensus is?
      1. Everyone&#39;s opinions are heard and encouraged
      2. Differences viewed as helpful, chances to learn more
      3. Everyone can understand the result and how it was reached
   2. What consensus is not?
      1. Unanimous agreement on end product
      2. Conflict is avoided, ignored
      3. Result is everyone&#39;s first choice
2. Consensus building process
   1. Stage 1: share all the ideas
      1. Facilitators invite audience to share any ideas they want included in the &quot;takeaway&quot; document
      2. All ideas put up initially, regardless of repetition or potential conflict
      3. Proposer of idea has a chance to explain how they came to it
   2. Stage 2: review ideas
      1. Facilitators go through items one at a time, providing opportunity for proposed changes to language, combinations with other proposals, etc.
